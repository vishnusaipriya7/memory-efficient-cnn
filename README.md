# 🧠 Memory-Efficient CNN for Low-Resource Devices

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** optimized for **low-resource and edge devices**. The model is designed using **depthwise separable convolutions** to reduce computation and memory usage, and is further optimized using **8-bit (INT8) post-training quantization** with **TensorFlow Lite**.

The optimized model is benchmarked for **CPU inference latency** and deployed using a **Python-based TensorFlow Lite inference application**, simulating real-world edge deployment.
