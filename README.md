 Memory-Efficient CNN for Low-Resource Devices
Overview

This project implements a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for low-resource and edge devices. The model is designed using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computation and memory usage, and is further optimized using 8-bit (INT8) post-training quantization with TensorFlow Lite.

The optimized model is benchmarked for CPU inference latency and deployed using a Python-based TensorFlow Lite inference application, simulating real-world edge deployment.
